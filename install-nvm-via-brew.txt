      Install NVM via Homebrew (MacOS)

1. make sure we already have homebrew installed
2. first uninstall existing node.js
3. before install nvm, its good idea to update the homebrew, by running this command "brew update"
4. then install nvm by running "brew install nvm"
5. next, create .nvm directory on home folder
6. home folder located at (open finder then click Go and click home)
7. by default when we open terminal, its open on home
8. edit directory ".bash_profile" on home (in my case it is ".zprofile")
9. open ".zprofile" on vim editor by running "vim ~/.zprofile"
10. add this below into ".zprofile" file

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "/usr/local/opt/nvm/nvm.sh" ] && \. "/usr/local/opt/nvm/nvm.sh"
[ -s "/usr/local/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion" ] && \. "/usr/local/opt/nvm/etc/bash_completion"

11. the sintact above usually show after we install nvm via homebrew, we can just copied and paste into ".zprofile"
12. in my case i use the sintact who showed after install nvm
